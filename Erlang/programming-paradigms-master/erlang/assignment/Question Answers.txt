Answers to the Questions of Assignment 3

================================ Questions ================================

1.
What would happen to linked mobile phone actors if the switch were to terminate abnormally?

2.
Suppose the switch terminates and is restarted by a supervisor.
Can you think of a solution which would allow the switch to recover 
its previous state (i.e., the list of subscriber MSISDNs and 
attached mobile phone actors) as if nothing ever happened?


================================ Answers ================================

1. 
Since the mobile phone actors do not trap the 'Exit' signal,
once the switch is terminated, through the link propagation,
all mobile actors will also be killed.

2. 
Firstly a supervisor would be adjusted and configured to handle the recovery of the switch. The switch itself also needs to be 
changed. The following is a possible solution:

    The switch:start/0 should be adjusted to take in a pre-created list which
    would be the previous state of the switch. This list (preset state) will 
    then be passed to the server_gen:start/2 -> server_gen:init/2 and then back
    to the switch:init/1

    The switch:init/1 will also need to be changed to now accept
    the state from the previous switch instance (non-empty list)

    The server_gen:loop/2, needs to have a try catch block to catch any error.
    If an error is encountered, the switch should append the current state end send
    to the supervisor a message with a PID, the error message, and the state in which the
    the switch was the last int, example supervisor receives something along the lines of:
    {'Exit', PID, Reason, State}

    The supervisor then would need to restart the switch passing the state as an argument.
